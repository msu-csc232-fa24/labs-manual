# Welcome to CSC232!

CSC232 - Data Structures

CSC232 is a continuation of CSC 131. Topics will include: algorithm design; complexity analysis; abstract data types and encapsulation; basic data structures and their application, including stacks, queues, linked lists and binary trees; dynamic memory allocation; recursion; sorting and searching; debugging techniques.

_**Prerequisite**: "C" or better in CSC 131; and MTH 261 or MTH 314 or MTH 315 or concurrent enrollment._

## Topics

* [Review C++ Fundamentals](lectures/mod01/index.md)
* Collections
* Stacks
* Queues and Priority Queues
* Lists and Sorted Lists
* Trees
