# Lab Summary

## LAB01 - Tools of the Trade Part 1: Version Control

An introduction to version control systems, namely, `git` and GitHub, a central location that hosts our repositories. In his lab we create a GitHub account (if needed) and link this account to our GitHub Classroom. With our accounts created and linked, we accept our first GitHub Classroom Assignment and use it to put to practice, basic version control operations such as cloning a repository, creating feature branches, updating files under version control, adding new files to version control, staging and commiting our changes, and pushing our commits to GitHub. As a final step, we learn how to create pull requests so that others can review our changes before they're merged into our main (or trunk) branch.

## LAB02 - Tools of the Trade Part 2: Build Tools

The student is introduced to basic build tools, including source code editors, compilers such as GNU C++ and build systems like `cmake`. Students learn to use GNU C++ compilers from the command line as well as link external libraries when building their executables. After learning the basics, we wrap up the lab with `cmake` and how it facilitates the construction of software.

## LAB03 - Functions and Recursion

Lab 3 is a look at void- and value-returning functions along with the development of recursive functions.

## LAB04 - Arrays

Lab 4 has the student working with one- and two-dimensional arrays. We learn to process arrays through the use of functions.

## LAB05 - Pointers, Nodes and Linked-Chains

## LAB06 - Array-based Collections

## LAB07 - Linked-based Collections

## LAB08 - Array-based Stacks
